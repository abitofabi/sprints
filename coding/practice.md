# Best Practice Method for the 10-Day LeetCode Sprint

To maximize learning and retention during this sprint, follow this structured approach every day:

---

## 1. Preview the Concept (15–30 mins)

- Quickly review the **core concept** or data structure for the day (e.g., Arrays, Sliding Window, Recursion).
- Use trusted resources: short videos, articles, or tutorials.
- Focus on understanding the **key idea**, **common patterns**, and **typical pitfalls**.

---

## 2. Warm-Up Problem (10–15 mins)

- Start with the easiest problem of the day’s list.
- Solve it fully to **build confidence** and get a feel for the concept.
- If stuck, review the concept or check hints sparingly.

---

## 3. Tackle Main Problems (1–1.5 hours)

- Solve the rest of the problems in order of difficulty.
- Write clean, readable code in Python (or SQL where applicable).
- Use **pseudocode or outlines** to plan your approach before coding if needed.
- If stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes, review solutions or discuss.

---

## 4. Review & Reflect (10 mins)

- Summarize what you learned in your own words.
- Note down any tricky parts or new patterns.
- Save your best solutions and mark problems to revisit later.
- Reflect on common mistakes or time management issues.

---

## 5. Keep a Lightweight Daily Log

- Use a simple digital note (Notion, Google Docs, or a text file).
- Write 3 bullets:
  - What concept(s) you focused on today
  - Which problems you solved
  - One thing you struggled with or want to improve

---

## 6. Practice Interview Mindset

- Timebox each problem (30–40 mins max).
- Practice explaining your solution aloud or in writing.
- Occasionally simulate whiteboard coding by writing pseudocode or key logic by hand.
- Focus on clarity and correctness over clever tricks.

---

## 7. Use Mock Interview Days Effectively

- Treat mock interview days like real interviews.
- Choose random medium problems and solve within a strict time limit.
- After solving, review and identify areas for improvement.

---

## Additional Tips

- Stay consistent — try to do the sprint daily or at least 5 days/week.
- Take short breaks if you feel stuck or fatigued.
- Use online forums or discussion boards if you need help — but try self-debugging first.
- Celebrate small wins — each problem solved is progress!
