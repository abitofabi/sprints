## üìå What is Amazon S3?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is:
- **Object storage** built to store and retrieve any amount of data
- **Serverless**, highly durable, and infinitely scalable
- Great for static assets, backups, logs, media, big data, and more

## üåü Key Features

| Feature             | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Object-based**     | Stores files + metadata + unique key |
| **Bucket**           | Top-level container, globally unique name |
| **No Hierarchy**     | Folder structure is virtual (prefix-based) |
| **Unlimited objects**| No limit on file count or bucket size |
| **Global namespace** | Bucket name is globally unique |
| **Read-after-write** | Strong consistency for all operations |

## üîí S3 Security & Access

| Concept                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Bucket Policies**       | JSON policies at bucket level |
| **IAM Policies**          | Who can access what, at user/role level |
| **ACLs (legacy)**         | Not recommended ‚Äî coarse-grained |
| **Encryption at rest**    | SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C, Client-Side |
| **Encryption in transit** | HTTPS (TLS) |
| **Block Public Access**   | Stops accidental exposure of S3 buckets |
| **Pre-Signed URLs**       | Time-limited access to private objects |

## üß† Storage Classes

| Storage Class              | Use Case                            | Durability | Availability | Retrieval |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Standard**               | General purpose, frequent access    | 11 9s      | 99.99%       | Instant   |
| **Intelligent-Tiering**    | Auto-moves objects between tiers    | 11 9s      | 99.9%+       | Instant   |
| **Standard-IA**            | Infrequent access, low cost         | 11 9s      | 99.9%        | Instant   |
| **One Zone-IA**            | Like Standard-IA but 1 AZ only      | 11 9s      | 99.5%        | Instant   |
| **Glacier Instant Retrieval** | Archived but instantly accessible| 11 9s      | 99.9%        | Instant   |
| **Glacier Flexible**       | Archival, minutes to hours to fetch | 11 9s      | N/A          | Delayed   |
| **Glacier Deep Archive**   | Long-term cold storage (12+ hrs)    | 11 9s      | N/A          | Slowest   |

## üõ†Ô∏è Key S3 Concepts

| Concept                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Versioning**           | Keeps multiple versions of an object |
| **Lifecycle Policies**   | Auto-transition or delete objects |
| **Replication**          | Copy objects to another bucket (Same or Cross-Region) |
| **MFA Delete**           | Adds extra security to deletion ops |
| **S3 Event Notifications** | Triggers Lambda, SNS, or SQS on changes |
| **Static Website Hosting**| Host a static site with public HTML/CSS |
| **Transfer Acceleration**| Speeds up uploads via CloudFront edge locations |
| **Object Lock**          | WORM (Write Once Read Many) ‚Äì for compliance |

---

## üß™ S3 Consistency

- **Strong consistency** for all operations
- You **immediately** read what you just wrote or deleted

## üß† Exam Traps & Gotchas

| Topic                   | Trap                  | Clarification |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Encryption              | SSE-KMS needs IAM perms | SSE-S3 doesn‚Äôt |
| Public Access           | Even if bucket policy allows, block public access might stop it | Both must align |
| Versioning              | Delete marker ‚â† delete | Can still access old versions |
| Static Website Hosting  | Doesn‚Äôt support HTTPS natively | Use CloudFront for HTTPS |
| Replication             | Must enable versioning | Not retroactive |
| Lifecycle Policies      | Won‚Äôt delete non-current unless explicitly configured | Must define transitions clearly |

---

## üåç S3 Integration Patterns

- **CloudFront**: To serve S3 static websites securely with HTTPS & caching
- **Athena**: Run SQL queries directly on S3 data
- **Lambda triggers**: Process files as they're uploaded
- **Glue Crawlers**: Discover schema from S3 datasets
