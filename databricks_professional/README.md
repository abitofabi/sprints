- [ ] Practice creating/managing Delta tables
- [ ] Set up Auto Loader (file ingestion from S3 or DBFS)
- [ ] Create LakeFlow Declarative Pipeline with DLT
- [ ] Compare DLT vs Spark jobs vs Materialized views
- [ ] Practice CDC with `APPLY CHANGES INTO` (LakeFlow)

---

### 📅 **Day 6: Unity Catalog + Lakehouse Federation + Delta Sharing**

**Goal**: Master access control and external sharing features

- [ ] Explore Unity Catalog: schemas, managed tables, grants
- [ ] Apply row-level filters and column masking

- [ ] Monitor with LakeFlow event logs
- [ ] Use `system.tables` for cost and auditing
- [ ] Apply file pruning, Z-order, data skipping, deletion vectors
- [ ] Analyze jobs for bottlenecks

---

### 📅 **Day 9: Data Security, Governance & Testing**

**Goal**: Learn to build compliant, high-quality pipelines

- [ ] Use Unity Catalog ACLs and fine-grained controls
- [ ] Implement masking (hashing, tokenization, generalization)
- [ ] Create test cases with `assertDataFrameEqual`, `assertSchemaEqual`
- [ ] Practice pseudonymization for PII

---

### 📅 **Day 10: Mock Review + Certification Strategy**

**Goal**: Prepare for the real exam day
