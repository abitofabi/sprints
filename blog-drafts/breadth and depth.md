# 🚀 2-Week Data Engineering Depth Sprint

**Goal:** Upgrade technical confidence — design & explain a streaming, governed pipeline end-to-end.  
**Time:** 4 hours / day × 14 days ≈ 56 hours total  
**Themes:**  
1️⃣ Vertical Depth – Streaming & Performance  
2️⃣ Horizontal Breadth – Governance & FinOps  

---

## 🗓️ Week 1 – Vertical Depth : Streaming & Pipeline Design

| Day | Focus | Tasks | Outcome |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|
| **Mon – Kick-off & Baseline** | Understand your current pipeline | • Sketch one real pipeline (Talend → Kafka → DB2/GCP)  <br>• Note batch bottlenecks + pain points  <br>• Read *Kafka fundamentals* (partitions, offsets, consumer groups) | Able to explain current vs target design in 2 min |
| **Tue – Streaming Core** | Hands-on Kafka | • Run a local or Confluent Cloud Kafka demo  <br>• Produce + consume sample messages  <br>• Observe lag / offset behavior | Confident describing stream flow |
| **Wed – Processing Layer** | Spark Structured Streaming / Flink SQL | • Complete one mini-tutorial  <br>• Add watermarking + windowing logic to a small example | Can describe “exactly-once” & late-data handling |
| **Thu – Performance & Reliability** | Optimize & tune | • Study partitioning, compaction, DLQ patterns  <br>• Adjust batch size / throughput in demo job | Can discuss throughput trade-offs |
| **Fri – Integrate Design** | Stitch everything together | • Redraw pipeline: ingestion → processing → storage  <br>• Add checkpoints + retries | Complete E2E streaming architecture diagram |

## 🗓️ Week 2 – Horizontal Breadth : Governance & Cost Awareness

| Day | Focus | Tasks | Outcome |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|
| **Mon – Data Catalog & Lineage** | Metadata visibility | • Explore GCP Data Catalog or AWS Glue Catalog  <br>• Document one dataset → owner, schema, SLA | Understand metadata + lineage concepts |
| **Tue – Quality & Validation** | Data trust | • Try Great Expectations or review rule-based validation in Talend | Know how to embed quality checks |
| **Wed – Security & Privacy** | Access control | • Read IAM basics, encryption at rest/in transit, tokenization  <br>• Sketch secure data zones | Can explain security layers |
| **Thu – FinOps & Optimization** | Cost awareness | • Estimate cloud cost (storage + compute)  <br>• List 3 cost levers (tiering, lifecycle rules, autoscaling) | Confident discussing cost trade-offs |
| **Fri – Sprint Review & Artifact** | Show your work | • Create 1-page *Data Product Sheet*:  \
  – Diagram  \
  – Lineage + quality summary  \
  – SLA + cost  \
  – Security overview  <br>• Record 60-sec walkthrough or short slide deck | Tangible proof of depth + breadth |
