## 🔄 Phases of the Cloud Adoption Journey

AWS CAF typically follows a phased approach. You may see terms like **Envision**, **Align**, **Launch**, and **Scale** — these aren’t strict AWS terminology but often used in cloud journeys inspired by CAF.

### 📌 Phase 1: Envision
- **Define the vision** for cloud adoption.
- Identify business outcomes, challenges, and leadership alignment.
- Answer the question: *Why cloud?*

### 📌 Phase 2: Align
- **Align stakeholders**, teams, and capabilities to support the vision.
- Build foundational skills, assign responsibilities.
- Assess readiness and build a transformation plan.

### 📌 Phase 3: Launch
- Begin **migrating or building workloads** in the cloud.
- Set up governance, security, and operational baselines.
- Implement in **pilot or MVP phases**.

### 📌 Phase 4: Scale
- Scale adoption across the organization.
- Optimize for performance, cost, and agility.
- Drive continuous improvement and innovation.
