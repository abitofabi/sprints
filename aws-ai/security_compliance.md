# 🔐 Security, Compliance, and Governance for AI Solutions

This section focuses on key AWS services and best practices that ensure secure, compliant, and well-governed AI/ML systems.

---

## 🛡️ 1. **Security in AI Solutions**

### 🔐 Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Controls who can access which AWS resources.
- Apply **least privilege** principle.
- Use **IAM roles** for service-to-service communication.

### 🔐 Amazon VPC & Private Endpoints
- Isolates ML workloads in a secure network boundary.
- Use **private endpoints** to avoid public internet exposure (e.g., SageMaker notebooks).

### 🔐 Encryption
- **At-rest**: AWS KMS + S3/SageMaker encryption.
- **In-transit**: HTTPS (TLS).

### 🔐 Logging & Monitoring
- Use **CloudTrail** to track API usage.
- Use **CloudWatch** and **SageMaker Model Monitor** for model/infrastructure logs.

## ✅ 2. **Compliance**

### 🔎 AWS Artifact
- Central portal to access **compliance reports** (e.g., SOC 2, ISO, GDPR).
- Download documents for audits.

### 📄 AWS Audit Manager
- Helps assess risks and automate evidence collection.
- Maps AWS activity to **compliance frameworks**.

### 🔍 AWS Config
- Tracks configuration changes and compliance with rules.
- Helps with auditing and governance.

### 🧠 Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
- Adds **ethical and responsible usage controls** to Gen AI.
- Enforces content filters and sensitive topic detection.

## 🧭 3. **Governance in AI Solutions**

### 🧠 Responsible AI Governance
- Includes **fairness**, **transparency**, **accountability**, and **privacy**.
- Use SageMaker Clarify for bias detection.

### 🧾 Model Versioning and Lifecycle
- Track experiments with SageMaker Experiments.
- Register, approve, deploy models via **SageMaker Model Registry**.

### 👥 Role Management
- IAM defines **resource-level access**.
- **SageMaker Role Manager** provides personas (e.g., data scientists, ML engineers).

## 📝 Notes

- Use **Amazon Macie** to detect and classify sensitive data (PII) in S3.
- **Amazon Inspector** checks for vulnerabilities in EC2/container images.
- Combine **SNS + Lambda** for automated alerts from logs or compliance events.
