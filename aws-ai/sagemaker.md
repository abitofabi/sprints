# 🤖 Amazon SageMaker – AWS AI Foundations Notes

---

## 💡 What is Amazon SageMaker?

Amazon SageMaker is a **fully managed service** that allows data scientists and developers to **build, train, and deploy ML models at scale**.

> 🧠 In AWS AI Foundations, you just need to know **what SageMaker does and where it fits**, not deep-dive coding or pipelines.

## 🔍 Key Capabilities (AIF Scope)

### 1. **Build**
- Use built-in **Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation
- Access built-in **algorithms and frameworks** (like XGBoost, TensorFlow, etc.)

### 2. **Train**
- **Managed training jobs** on scalable infrastructure
- **Automatic Model Tuning** (hyperparameter optimization)
- Train on your own data stored in **S3**

### 3. **Deploy**
- **One-click deployment** to a hosted endpoint
- Supports **real-time inference** and **batch transform jobs**

## 📝 Foundation-Level Exam Tips

- SageMaker is used **when you want to customize ML workflows**
- For **low-code/no-code** AI → consider **SageMaker Canvas**
- For **automated ML model building** → use **SageMaker Autopilot**
- For **prebuilt models/templates** → use **SageMaker JumpStart**
- To monitor model quality post-deployment → use **SageMaker Model Monitor**
- For **training with human labeling** → use **SageMaker Ground Truth**
