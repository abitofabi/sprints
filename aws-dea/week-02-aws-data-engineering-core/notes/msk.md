# ‚öîÔ∏è AWS Kinesis vs Amazon MSK ‚Äì Streaming Showdown

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Amazon MSK?

**MSK = Managed Kafka**

- Kafka is an **open-source distributed event streaming platform**
- MSK = Fully managed Kafka with all its APIs + tooling
- You get native Kafka: brokers, ZooKeeper (or KRaft), partitions, consumer groups

### ‚úÖ Why Use MSK?

- You already use Apache Kafka on-prem
- You need Kafka ecosystem features (Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams)
- Your apps depend on Kafka APIs, semantics, or ordering guarantees

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is Kinesis?

**Kinesis = AWS-native streaming platform**

- Purpose-built for **serverless stream ingestion & analytics**
- Works best when you don't care about underlying infra or Kafka features

| **Ordering**             | Per shard                                   | Per partition                              |
| **Exactly-once Semantics** | ‚ùå (at-least-once by default)              | ‚úÖ via idempotent producer + transactions  |
| **Pricing Model**        | Per GB + shard/sec (KPU if Analytics)       | Per broker EC2 + storage + data transfer   |
| **Learning Curve**       | üòÑ Easy                                     | üòµ Steep for Kafka beginners                |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Management

### Kinesis

- Super quick to deploy
- No brokers, partitions, ZooKeeper to worry about
- Scaling = add shards (or switch to On-Demand)

### MSK

- You pick:
  - Broker type (e.g., `kafka.m5.large`)
  - Storage per broker
  - Kafka version
- AWS handles patching, backups, monitoring
- You still run producer/consumer code + manage partitions

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Use Cases ‚Äì When to Use What?

### üåÄ Choose **Kinesis** if:

- You want **serverless**, auto-scaling ingestion
- You're starting fresh on AWS (no Kafka baggage)
- Integration with Firehose, Lambda, Glue, Athena is important
- Simpler ops & cost control matter

### üß± Choose **MSK** if:

- You're migrating from on-prem **Apache Kafka**
- You need **Kafka Connect, Streams, or Kafka ecosystem tools**
- You want full control over partitioning, offset tracking, delivery semantics
- You need **exactly-once delivery** or Kafka-style ordering

| DevOps Load        | Low (AWS handles scaling, uptime)   | Medium-High (offsets, partitions)   |
| TCO (cost)         | Predictable, but adds up with scale | Cheaper at large scale, but complex |

## üîö TL;DR

- **Kinesis** is best for:
  - Serverless streaming
  - AWS-native integrations
  - Simplicity + fast delivery
