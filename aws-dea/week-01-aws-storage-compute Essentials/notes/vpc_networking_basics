# AWS DEA - Day 5 Notes: VPC & Networking Basics üåêüö¶

## 1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Isolated virtual network in AWS where you launch AWS resources.
- Define IP range using CIDR blocks (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
- Allows control over network configuration.

## 2. Subnets
- Subdivide VPC CIDR block into smaller IP ranges.
- Types:
  - Public Subnet: Has route to Internet Gateway (IGW).
  - Private Subnet: No direct internet access, usually uses NAT Gateway for outbound internet.
  
## 3. Internet Gateway (IGW)
- Allows communication between instances in VPC and the internet.
- Attached to VPC.

## 4. NAT Gateway
- Enables instances in private subnets to access the internet (for updates, downloads) without exposing them publicly.

## 5. Route Tables
- Controls routing of traffic within the VPC and to external networks.
- Routes define where traffic destined to IP ranges should go (e.g., IGW, NAT, peering).

## 6. Security Groups
- Virtual firewall at instance level.
- Stateful: responses to allowed inbound traffic are automatically allowed outbound.
- Rules define allowed inbound and outbound traffic by protocol, port, and source/destination.

## 7. Network ACLs (NACLs)
- Optional subnet-level firewall.
- Stateless: each request and response must be allowed explicitly.
- Controls inbound and outbound traffic for subnets.

## 8. VPC Endpoints (Briefly)
- Enable private connections between VPC and supported AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB) without using public IPs.

## No Code Practice for Today  
- Focused on conceptual understanding and hands-on setup in AWS Console/CLI.
- Recommended: Create a sample VPC, subnets, IGW, NAT, security groups, and test EC2 instance connectivity.
