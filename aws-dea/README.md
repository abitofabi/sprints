## Notes
- Complexity levels: Easy < Medium < Hard
- Mini projects focus on cost-effective hands-on practice, leveraging AWS Free Tier.
- Remember to delete AWS resources after use to avoid unexpected charges.
- This sprint plan is fully aligned with the 2025 AWS DEA-C01 exam syllabus and Stephen Maarek‚Äôs course.
- Use this as a structured roadmap to build expertise and confidence for the exam and real-world data engineering.
